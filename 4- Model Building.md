## Model Building

### Linear Regression Model
Given the nature of the data, a simple linear regression model was chosen to analyze the relationship between radio promotion budget and sales. The linear regression formula used is:

\[
\text{Sales} = \text{Intercept} + (\text{Slope} \times \text{Radio Promotion Budget})
\]

### Model Fitting
The model was fitted to the cleaned data using the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method. This section details the steps taken to fit the model and the Python libraries used.
