## Executive Summary

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the TikTok dataset provided significant insights into user engagement metrics and video characteristics. The key findings from the analysis are summarized below:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values, resulting in a cleaner dataset for analysis. This process helped in ensuring the accuracy of the analysis.

2. **Correlation Analysis:** The correlation heatmap revealed strong relationships between `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, and `video_share_count`. These metrics are highly interrelated, indicating that popular videos tend to receive both more likes and shares.

3. **Categorical Analysis:** Verified users generally have higher video view counts compared to non-verified users. Similarly, the analysis of claim status shows that claim videos often have higher engagement metrics than opinion videos.

4. **Visualizations:** Various visualizations were created to better understand the distribution of data and the relationships between variables. The scatter plots and box plots helped in identifying patterns and outliers in the data.

Based on these findings, it is recommended that TikTok's data team further explores the impact of verified status and claim status on user engagement metrics. This could lead to improved content moderation strategies and better prediction models for video claims.
