## Model Assumptions & Validation

### Assumption Checks
Before relying on the results, we must ensure that the assumptions of linear regression are met. This includes checking for linearity, normality of residuals, and homoscedasticity.

### Residual Analysis
The distribution of the residuals is examined to confirm that they are normally distributed, which is crucial for the validity of our model.
