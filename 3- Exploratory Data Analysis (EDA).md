## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Initial Data Exploration
We begin by displaying the first few rows of the dataset and providing basic descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of the data.

### Visualizations
To better understand the relationship between the radio promotion budget and sales, we created scatter plots and histograms. These visualizations help us identify any patterns or trends in the data.
