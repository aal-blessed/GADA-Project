### Summary of Model Results
The model output includes the coefficients, including the slope and intercept, which are key to understanding the relationship between the variables. We also assess the statistical significance of the model using metrics like the p-value and R-squared value.

### Interpretation of Results
The slope indicates how much sales are expected to increase for each additional million dollars spent on radio promotion. The intercept represents the baseline sales when no money is spent on radio promotion.
